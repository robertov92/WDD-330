    <h1>Week 1 - Notes</h1>
    <h2>Doing Stuff with Web Things</h2>
    <h3>Section 2.3</h3>
    <p>Below is the example from section 2.3 of the book. The example is a bit different than the one in the book. I added an if-else statement to the displayStory() function so the user could display the story without needed to 'Find and Edit It' first.
        If the user hasn't saved his story, the program outputs what the user currently has typed in the textarea. I also added some HTML tags to the output so the user doesn't need to add those into the textarea.</p>
    <p>Please give it a try!</p>
    <h4>Story Editor</h4>
    Story Name:<input id=name_input></input>
    <section>
        <button onclick="loadStory()">Find and Edit It</button>
        <button onclick="saveStory()">Save It</button>
        <button onclick="displayStory()">Display It</button>
    </section>
    <textarea id="story_editor" placeholder="Write a totally awesome story here."></textarea>
    <section id="story_display"></section>
    <h4>Questions</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Where are these stories saved? I googled it and found out that the localStorage() method saves key-value pairs in the browser. It is interesting to know that there are so many ways to save the data we use in our programs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Section 3 to the End of Book</h3>
    <p>Everything felt like a review to me :)</p>
    <h2>Master Mobile UX</h2>
    <h3>Key concepts to remember</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rewire your brain for mobile first: I need to design for mobile devices first. The web started only with desktop computers in mind. However, mobile devices are skyrocketing the market, while desktop computers are declining in consumption.</li>
        <li>Understand Users: Users value simplicity, speed, and sometimes they 'don't know what they want, until you show it to them'(Steve Jobs).</li>
        <li>Strategic Menu Design: Nav bar can go to the bottom of the screen so users can reach it with their thumbs. Replace the hamburger button with a button labeled 'Menu.'</li>
        <li>Mobile-Friendly Forms: The narrator used some very cool animations to make the form very friendly. This video is worth watching again.</li>
        <li>Mobile Advertising User Experience: Try to get rid of as much advertising as possible because people visit your website for content, not for advertisment. This video is also worth watching again.</li>
    </ol>
